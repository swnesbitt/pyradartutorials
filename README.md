# pyradartutorials

This set of tutorials is being developed as part of a Fall 2017 brown bag seminar series on advanced radar data analysis using python at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign.  It is hoped that this series will provide an introductory toolkit for anyone looking to learn how to analyze radar data.
